# idbs-demo-webapp
A web app demonstrating use of the Identity Binder Service.

Goals:

1. Demonstrate that the app can successfully query the Identity Binding Service by simply displaying the result of the query on the page.
2. Design a simple account interface where users have access to some resource(s).
3. Demonstrate that a user can log in to the app on separate accounts, bind them using the Identity Binding Service, and thus have access to the same resource(s) via the bound identity.
